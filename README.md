# TwoTouch

Two player mobile game based on reaction time made at Hack Western. My first Hackathon (March 27-29).


Description: Numbers will display on the screen to indicate how many fingers to tap with. First person to react gets a point.
The first person to 10 points wins!

Art done by: Amy Xiao & Thanvin Giridhar


Bugs: 
  Fingers placed on both sides of the screen can add up to the target number. 
  Memory problem when largeHeap is not set (possibly have to do with only activity implementation?).
